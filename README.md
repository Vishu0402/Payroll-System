# Payroll-System

The project has multiple classes and sub-classes with many features within them. Basic operations users can perform via this program project that are based on file handling are adding new employee record, modifying employee record and deleting record, displaying one or all employee's record. Besides these, payroll management also allows users to print the salary slip for a particular employee. This project is large, complete and I tried our best to make it error- free. The source code is very long - over 774 lines and developed in Code Blocks compiler.
